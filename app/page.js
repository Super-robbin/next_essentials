// This is a regular React component but treated in a special way by NextJS.
// It is treated as a server component and executed on the server,
// and it's then the returned JSX code that's sent over the wire to the browser to be rendered
// as HTML, and that's why we can see what we see here, thanks to this component.

// IMPORTANT: The file name (page) matters because it tells NextJS that we want to have this as a page.
